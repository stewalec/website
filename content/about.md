## By Day

Iâ€™m a technology professional who works in the public sector. I have a computer science background, but much of my career has revolved around leadership and management in a variety of capacities.

## By Night

My interests are constantly changing, but I always come back to Linux and *BSD, homelabbing and selfhosting, and programming in Python and Go.

## Other

Outside of technical interests and computer screens, I like to read, write, and spend time outdoors. Sometimes I also dabble with philosophy, origami, and the piano.
