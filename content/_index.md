# Hi, I’m Alec.

I’m a tech professional on a journey trying to...

1. Explore the concepts, ideas, and forces that impact our human experience.
1. Discover how to make and use technology and the internet better.
1. Understand the right relationship between technology and humanity.

As I embark on this journey, this website serves as my curiosity playground and digital garden for public learning and self-expression.

You can read [about me](/about), see what I’m doing [now](/now), [get in touch](/contact), or check out some of my recent notes and articles below.
